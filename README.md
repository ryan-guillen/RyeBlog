# RyeBlog

A small blog website I made.  
The front end is made with Next.js 13, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.  
The back end is made with Spring Boot and MongoDB.  

backend/src/main/resources/application.properties is in .gitignore because it contains
my login information for MongoDB. You will have to provide your own information to get
this to work on your end.
